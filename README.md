# The-Administrator
## General
Founded in 2020, The Administrator was intitially created as a hobby by me, fighter_Ethan#6071, to use privately in my own servers.
However, The Administrator has grown to be the cornerstone of Auxillium Discord Bots, or ADB. I never imagined that my bot would make it this far, let alone be this sophisticated!

Today, The Administrator is used in over 13 servers and growing!
