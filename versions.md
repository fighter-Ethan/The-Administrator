## The Administrator v. 1.5.2
### March 17, 2022

  Hey all! I've come out with a quick update to the bot. 

> **Fixed the poll command**. You no longer have to enter how many options you want in your poll! Also, you must have AT LEAST two options or the poll will not work.

> **Added a roast picture**. Ever felt like a monster? You will.

> **Fixed the help menu a bit**. This is really just housekeeping.


Stay tuned for a new update SOON! The next one will be BIG!

## The Administrator v. 1.5.1
### March 10, 2022 

Hey everyone! It's been a LONG time since the last time I updated The Administrator, but I've finally done it! Here's what the new, shiny & improved bot has to offer.

> **Reorganization of the help menu**. Ever felt that the help menu was disorganized and too long? We did too. There are now three different categories to help with this, all of which can be retrieved with simple commands. These categories are admin, emotes, and fun! 


> **Addition of commands to the help menu.** Woah, another update to the help menu? You betcha! I added many commands that were not included in the help menu for easier access to how to use them.

> **Temporary Command: -standwithukraine [user]**. Standing with Ukraine has never been more important, and this command allows you to put your avatar over the Ukrainian flag, in case you want a new profile picture.

That's all for now! Enjoy the update, and keep your eyes open for 1.5.2, coming very soon to a discord server near you...

## Version 1.5.0
I have not been recording updates, so I will now start at 1.5.0! This update simply includes this file as well as some  code cleanup!
